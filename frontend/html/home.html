    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p id="about-text">My programming interest came about because of my craving for solving real
       world problems. Since then it has been an obssession. My taste drives me to write 
       code that is user-centric. I pay attention to the details while also keeping up
       with the technologies that enhance user experience.</p>
    <h3>My Projects</h3>

      <h3>Glass Spades</h3>
      <img src="/Landscape-homepage-black.jpg" alt="Glass Spades Icon" />
      <p>Glass Spades, a real estate agency, contracted me to create a website for them.
        The goal was to have one that had a good performance score and quick loading
        speed. Responsive web design was a key factor given most users access the internet
        through their mobile phones.
