      <p>I have always been a curious soul. It was only a matter of time until I discovered
        computers. Once I did, there was no looking back. It makes me happy when I start with
        a blank canvas and grow it into this reflection of my thoughts, putting into the world
        what started as a single pixel.

        I enjoy creating websites that help clients achieve their goals. Whether it's
        making your users happy or satisfied. Your goal is my mission. Companies and individuals
        alike have visions of what they would like their brands to portray. I help you bring it
        to life. I use whatever tools suit the job and my skillset is diverse.
      </p>
      <p>I am looking forward to working with you on your next big project.</p>

            <p>Glass Spades Real Estate is a young real estate agency in Kenya. It is an
              organization that understood the necessity for a modern website using modern
              technologies. 
              They wanted a website that would compete well and give the young 
              company a fighting chance in a competitive market space under a tough economy.
            </p>
            <p>User experience was the main focus both for them and for me. We understood
              that majority of our users are on mobile phone. We therefore created a
              website that was both responsive and accessible to all our users. We
              were going for a feel that was both clean and elegant in order to bring
              out the best of the houses that they were marketing.
            </p>
            <p>The company gave me a blank canvas in terms of the tech stack. The only
              condition was to create a backend that could scale to handle load both
              in the present and in the future. I used Javascript in the frontend and
              Node.js in the backend. The database management system is MongoDB which
              could handle the flexibility they needed in data storage.

            Every programmer needs a website and we all try to make them a representation
            of what we like aesthetically. It also represents your programming style
            and skill. The portfolio website, the one you are using at the moment,
            is minimalistic. I believe in communicating what I want without making noise.
            That is the guiding theme of this website. I hope you enjoy it.
            </p>
            <p>The website is created as a single page app and you'll notice as you click
              about on the other links. While I could have used frameworks, the essence is
              to display a clear understanding of the fundamentals on which frameworks are
              built on top of.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website is built using Javascript, Node.js on the backend. There is a lot
              of HTML and CSS to get the animations working.

            <p>
              The MEA Tax Project is a project that I undertook for the US mission employees.
              According to the US laws, employees file their own taxes and pay their own
              government while in Kenya it is the opposite. Employers withhold their employees
              taxes and file them with the Kenya Revenue Authority. This puts a lot of
              these employees under undue stress as many are not familiar with the relevant
              tax laws to start doing so on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              The employees came together and formed an association that assists them to
              create the necessary tax file, P9 and provides guidance on how to go about it.
              The number of employees in the association is over 400. The due date for the
              P9 forms is on June 30. For two years, the accountants were collecting the 
              necessary financial information and creating the P9 forms for each employee.
              It was a strenous task.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program compresses what was 6 months of labor into 5 minutes. All of which
              is error free. It has allowed the accountants to focus on other tasks and
              the employees to file their taxes on time. All the program needs is the 
              employee information such as their name, tax pin, and salary information. The
              program them computes the taxes due per employee. It then creates the P9 form
              which is an excel form converted into a PDF and then shared with the employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tech stack used in the project is Python which has a very good excel package,
              Openpyxl. The file conversion is done through Linux to automate the file conversion.
            </p>
