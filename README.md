# Kirera.Africa
My portfolio website is/will always be a work in progress. Sometimes I want to experiment with new
technologies and other times I want it to reflect who I have become.

To view the website, check it out at kirera.africa. If you find the website is not working, then it's
probably because I lacked the funds to pay for the server. Judge the code, not the person! :innocent:

With this iteration, I wanted to showcase:
- Personal statement
- Work experience
- Personal projects
- Open source contributions
- Education
- Certifications

## Data Schema

- startDate: date
- endDate: date | 'ongoing'
